# oss-automatic-bug-assignment
This repository contains the source code used in the experiments of the Master's Thesis "Tuning of machine learning algorithms for automatic bug assignment" (Daniel Artchounin), conducted on Eclipse JDT and Mozilla Firefox. In this Master's Thesis, a systematic four-step method to find some of the best configurations of several machine learning algorithms intending to solve the automatic bug assignment problem has been introduced. This method has been evaluated on 66 066 bug reports of Ericsson, 24 450 bug reports of Eclipse JDT and 30 358 bug reports of Mozilla Firefox.
